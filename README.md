# Wireles SDN Ad-hoc network for vehicular communication

## Description
Software Defined Network (SDN) is a vastly evolving network architecture approach that
physically separates the network control plane from the data plane. The interconnection
devices take forwarding decisions solely based on a set of multi-criteria policy rules
defined by external applications called controllers. Vehicular communication becomes s
trending topic in the transportation technology. Most of the researchers pay attention to
the development of vehicular communication using wireless Software Defined Network in
order to overcome from issues such as lack of intelligence and scalability of the network.
The recent developments in SDN have paved the way to control and manage wireless
ad-hoc networks. Wireless ad-hoc networks are distributed networks that work without
fixed infrastructure and in which each network node is willing to forward network packets
for other network nodes which in return provides a reliable platform in vehicleto-vehicle
communication. The objective of this research is to review some benefits of wireless SDN
and how SDN can be used to implement network on vehicle to vehicle communication.
