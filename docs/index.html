    <h1>Wireles SDN Ad hoc Network For Vehicular Communication</h1>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    Software Defined Network (SDN) is a vastly evolving network architecture approach that
    physically separates the network control plane from the data plane. The interconnection
    devices take forwarding decisions solely based on a set of multi-criteria policy rules
    defined by external applications called controllers. Vehicular communication becomes s
    trending topic in the transportation technology. Most of the researchers pay attention to
    the development of vehicular communication using wireless Software Defined Network in
    order to overcome from issues such as lack of intelligence and scalability of the network.
    The recent developments in SDN have paved the way to control and manage wireless
    ad-hoc networks. Wireless ad-hoc networks are distributed networks that work without
    fixed infrastructure and in which each network node is willing to forward network packets
    for other network nodes which in return provides a reliable platform in vehicleto-vehicle
    communication. The objective of this research is to review some benefits of wireless SDN
    and how SDN can be used to implement network on vehicle to vehicle communication.
